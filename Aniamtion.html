            <h1>I am an animator, and I'm proud of my work! I believe that my animations are of high quality, and that I have much to be proud of.

                When creating an animation, there are many things to consider and much to think about â€“ making sure characters are fluid,
                storylines make sense, and that the overall product reflects the vision you have created.
                Not to mention, there is the aspect of presentation to consider as well! Animations are works of art, and as such,
                should be presented in a way that highlights all their beauty and charm.</h1>
